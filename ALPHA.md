# Point Network Alpha Testing Guide

![alpha screenshot](resources/alpha_screenshot_2.png)

## Notes

- This is experimental alpha software! If you can and know how, better test it on a virtual machine first (fresh Ubuntu is recommended). If you are not tech-savvy, maybe wait for others to try it out first and see how it goes
- Any troubles? Ask us in our Telegram group: [https://t.me/pointnetworkchat](https://t.me/pointnetworkchat)

## Installation

_Note: As a last resort measure, if you experience issues but still want to be recorded on the blockchain as one of the alpha testers (and in case we can't help you in the alpha testers group at [https://t.me/pointnetworkalpha](https://t.me/pointnetworkalpha)), try running it in an Ubuntu virtual machine. So far, Ubuntu users reported they experience the most smooth ride._

### Linux

_Note: At the moment, we only support `.deb` (Debian-based distributions, like Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint) and `.rpm` (Red Hat) installation packages. In the future we will provide support other distributions._

3. Double click the extracted `.deb` or `.rpm` file to begin the installation of Point Dashboard
4. Search for `Point` in your applications and click on it to run Point Dashboard
5. Click on _Start Installation_ to start installing Point Network
6. Generate a new seed phrase, **WRITE IT DOWN SOMEWHERE SAFE** and click on _I have it written down, continue_ to confirm your seed phrase
7. When done, Point Browser will open, where you will be able to create an identity
8. Enjoy the true web 3.0!

## After Installation

1. When you register a new secret phrase, and you want to test it again, don't lose it - it will qualify you to be on the list of alpha testers. Next time, you can just *log in* with this phrase instead of registering another one
2. Please report back to the group with screenshots, everyone would love to see each other's progress! https://t.me/pointnetworkchat
